# cyclegan-and-inceptionv3-for-alzheimer-s-disease

In this Jupyter notebook, the problem of Alzheimer's disease classification is approached using two deep learning mothods. In a first step, the dataset of images used is increased by generating new synthetic images obtained through a CycleGAN model trained with real images. Finally, the classification of the presence of the disease is carried out through the pretrained classification model Inception V3.
