    "## 1 - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many fields, including the medical one. The use of Machine Learning, Deep Learning techniques and other artificial intelligence techniques in the medical field has made it possible to develop predictive models capable of supporting doctors and researchers in their daily activities.\n",
    "One of the main areas of use of the AI in the medical field concerns the analysis of medical images, such as those obtained from magnetic resonances, computerized tomographs and radiographs. However, one of the main problems in the use of the AI in this context is represented by the difficulty of finding dataset of medical images sufficiently large and accurate to train the models. This is due to the privacy of patients and the limitations imposed by personal data protection regulations.\n",
    "To overcome this difficulty, different images generator models are used, such as GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAE (Variational Auto-Encoders) and GPTs (Generative Pretrained Transformers). These models are able to generate new images starting from existing ones, thus creating artificial datasets of medical images that can be used for training artificial intelligence models.\n",
    "In summary, the use of AI in the medical field is revolutionizing the approach to diagnosis and treatment of diseases, allowing doctors to have access to increasingly advanced support tools. However, important challenges are still to be faced, such as that of finding dataset of high quality medical images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of the identification of Alzheimer's disease is taken as an example of how AI can be used in the medical field. In a recent study by Islam and Zhang [1], they tackled the problem by useing a generative GAN model to augment the training dataset, resulting in a $10\\%$ improvement in disease classification. In this work, the same problem is approached, but following the same way taken by Bargshady et al. [2] as described in their study on the classification of Covid-19 in X-ray images. In a first step, the dataset of images used is increased by generating new synthetic images obtained through a CycleGAN model trained with real images. Finally, the classification of the presence of the disease is carried out through the pretrained classification model Inception V3."

    "\n",
    "Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disorder in humans that gradually leads to the loss of memory and other intellectual abilities to such an extent that it interferes with daily life. Alzheimer's is not a normal part of aging, although the greatest known risk factor is increasing age, and the majority of people affected by Alzheimer's are $65$ years and older. However, Alzheimer's is not solely a disease of old age. Up to $5\\%$ of people with this disease experience early onset Alzheimer's (also known as \"early onset\"), which often occurs when a person is in their forties to fifties or between the ages of fifty and sixty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The onset of the disease and its progression are determined by the way specific biomarkers change:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. β-amyloid (indicating deposition of amyloid in plaques outside the cell, measured in CSF and by amyloid PET)\n",
    "2. Tau (indicating the formation of tau fibrils with the neurons)\n",
    "3. Glucose metabolism (measured on PET, indicating damage to neurons)\n",
    "4. Structural MRI (indicating damage to brain structure)\n",
    "5. Cognitive impairment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, disease recognition is primarily based on the structural differences between the brain of a healthy patient and the brain of an affected patient. Structural changes in the Alzheimer's-afflicted brain compared to a normal brain include cortical thinning, ventricular expansion, widening of the sulci, and overall loss of brain volume.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [3] is a collaborative project involving public institutions and private pharmaceutical companies. Since its establishment in 2004, it has brought together researchers from around the world with the goal of focusing their efforts on studying the progression of the disease through neuroimaging, the study of biochemical processes, and the identification of genetic biomarkers. The knowledge gained allows for the improvement of clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of the disease, as well as the development and standardization of protocols, but most importantly, the sharing of collected data and results.\n",
    "For this study, the ADNI1 image dataset was used, utilizing only images classified as CN (Cognitively Normal patients) and AD (Advanced-stage positive patients). This dataset comprises a total of $2408$ three-dimensional images ($1204$ CN type and $1204$ AD type) obtained through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on patients aged between $55$ and $92$ years.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, scanners used in the medical field produce images in a proprietary format, posing a significant barrier to open diagnostics. In this regard, a solution has been provided by the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) [4], which has released a new standard and open format called nitifi, which every neuroimaging package should support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest volumetric element that composes a three-dimensional image is the voxel, which is the counterpart of the pixel that represents the unit of measurement in a two-dimensional image. Each voxel has associated numerical values that represent measurable properties or independent variables (e.g., color, opacity, density, material, coverage ratio, refractive index, velocity, force, time) of the real phenomenon or object residing within the volume unit represented by that voxel. In addition, a 3D image can be considered as an overlay of stacked 2D slices, one on top of another.\n",

    "3. The affine matrix.\n",

    "**The header** contain metadata about the scan, such as the units of measurement, the voxel size, etc. In case of fMRI files, there is a fourth dimension thet represents the “time” dimension, which is the time that elapses between the acquisition of two consecutive volumes. For example, you could have an image of dimensions $(80, 80, 44, 50)$, where the first three numbers represent the spatial dimensions $(X, Y, Z)$, and the last number refers to the number of temporal time points used in the scan. In this case, it is possible to have $80\\times80\\times44$ voxels with a size of $2.7\\times2.7\\times2.97 mm$ scanned every $0.7$ seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data** contained in a NIfTI file represents the intensities of the voxels and is expressed with numerical values that are associated with colors during the image plotting stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The affine matrix A** is responsible for relating the spatial coordinates of the voxels to the world spatial coordinates. It is assumed that the coordinate $(0, 0, 0)$ corresponds to the $\\textit{isocenter}$, and the first axis is oriented from left to right, the second axis from posterior to anterior, and the third axis from inferior to superior. At this point, there are two conventions regarding the orientation of the axes. With $RAS+$, the orientation is identified as right, anterior, and superior of the isocenter as positive, and left, posterior, and inferior of the isocenter as negative, thus defined as $RAS-$.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the image-to-image translation technique, it is possible to teach a model the mapping between an input image and an output image by using a training set of paired images. However, it is not always possible to leverage this technique since obtaining paired image sets is not always feasible. An alternative method to achieve the same result was introduced by Zhu et al. [5] in 2019, using a new technique called CycleGAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CycleGAN, the basic idea is to translate an image from the source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the absence of paired samples. Given two starting datasets, ${x} \\in X$ and ${y} \\in Y$, the model is trained to learn the mappings $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ and $F: Y \\rightarrow X$ by introducing two adversarial discriminators $D_x$, which aim to distinguish between the original images ${x}$ and the translated ones ${F(y)}$, and $D_y$, which aims to distinguish between the original images ${y}$ and the translated ones ${G(x)}$. Then, $D_x$ and $D_y$ are considered as estimates of the probability that an element belongs to its reference domain. The ultimate objective that the model aims to achieve consists of two components: the adversarial loss and the cycle consistency loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $E_{x \\sim p_{data}(x)}$ and $E_{y \\sim p_{data}(y)}$ be the expected values of the data distributions $x \\sim p_{data}(x)$ and $y \\sim p_{data}(y)$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **adversarial loss** aims to align the distribution of generated images with the data distribution in the target domain. For the mapping function $G: X \\rightarrow Y$, it can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{GAN}(G,D_y,X,Y)=E_{y \\sim p_{data}(y)}[log D_y(y)]+E_{x \\sim p_{data}(x)}[1-log D_y(G(x))]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G$ attempts to generate an image $G(x)$ that is similar to the images in the $Y$ domain, and therefore try to minimize the adversarial loss\n",

    "$D_y$ tries to distinguish the generated image $G(x)$ from the real image $y$, and therefore try to maximize the adversarial loss\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{max}_{D_y} L_{GAN}(G,D_y,X,Y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for the mapping function $F: Y \\rightarrow X$, it can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{GAN}(F,D_x,Y,X)=E_{x \\sim p_{data}(x)}[log D_x(x)]+E_{y \\sim p_{data}(y)}[1-log D_x(F(y))]$$\n",

    "and for the adversarial loss, it follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{min}_F \\text{max}_{D_x} L_{GAN}(F,D_x,Y,X)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With a sufficiently large capacity, during adversarial training, a network can map the same set of input images to any random permutation of images in the target domain, where each learned mapping can lead to an output distribution that matches the target distribution. To reduce the potential space of possible mapping functions, only those functions that possess the property of cycle consistency are considered. This requirement translates into wanting the cycle translation to be able to retrieve the original image for each image in the respective domain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow F(G(x)) \\rightarrow x$$\n",
    "$$y \\rightarrow F \\rightarrow G(F(y)) \\rightarrow y$$\n",

    "\n",
    "So, the overall objective can be rewritten as\n",
    "\n",

    "The U-NET architecture is a design concept initially developed for semantic segmentation, primarily for processing biomedical images and later applied to other fields as well. It is a CNN developed by O. Ronneberger et al. [6] at the Computer Science Department of the University of Freiburg. Semantic segmentation refers to assigning a class to each pixel in the image, highlighting areas composed of pixels belonging to the same category. Models using this architecture utilize segmentation maps as target variables. The U-NET architecture consists of an encoder, a decoder, and a skip connection between these two parts.\n",

    "In a U-Net, **skip connections** are used to pass information from previous convolutional layers to the deconvolutional layers. Essentially, what is transmitted is the location of the feature extracted from the convolutional layers. The skip connections tell the network where the features come from in the image. This is done by concatenating the last layer in the convolutional block with the first layer in the opposite deconvolutional block. The U-Net is symmetric: the dimensions of the opposing layers will be the same. This simplifies combining the layers into a single tensor. The convolution is then performed as usual by running the kernel on the concatenated tensor. \n",

Similarly, the decoder was implemented with $8$ Transpose Convolutional layers followed by Batch Normalization, and only the first three layers include a dropout with a rate of $0.2$. Again, a ReLU activation function was used. Additionally, Figure below shows the schema used for the concatenation in the U-Net architecture.\n",

    "InceptionV3 has been trained on a large dataset of images called ImageNet, which contains millions of images divided into different categories. During training, the model learns to recognize a wide range of objects and concepts present in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "A distinctive feature of InceptionV3 is the use of 1x1 convolutions used for dimensionality reduction, followed by larger convolutions to capture features at different scales. These help reduce the dimension of input channels and improve the computational efficiency of the model. In particular, in its initial version, each module that composes the entire model (Naive form) consisted of convolutional layers of different sizes, namely $1\\times1$, $3\\times3$, and $5\\times5$ convolutional layers. One of the bottlenecks of this initial version was represented by the computationally expensive $5\\times5$ convolutional layers. To overcome this issue, in version $3$, both the $5\\times5$ and $3\\times3$ convolutional layers were replaced with asymmetric convolutions of the type $1\\times n$ and $n \\times1$. A two-layer solution like the one just described costs about $33\\%$ less for the same number of output filters when the number of input and output filters is the same. The following figure illustrates the evolution of the Naive form module from its initial version to the current optimized version, transitioning to a classical asymmetric convolutional structure.\n",

    "<img src=\"./Images/naive_form.png\" alt=\"naiveform\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The full model itself consists of symmetric and asymmetric basic components, including convolutions, average pooling, max pooling, concatenations, dropouts, and fully connected layers. Batch normalization is widely used throughout the model and applied to the activation inputs. The loss is calculated using Softmax.\n",

    "As for image classification, the entire ADNI1 dataset was expanded by adding the images generated by the CycleGAN model. The obtained result shows that the implemented classifier is weak in categorizing the images. In particular, the obtained confusion matrix (Figure below) highlights how the modified InceptionV3 model has problems classifying images depicting MRIs of healthy subjects. This is reflected in a significantly low accuracy value (ACC), and the high values of MSE and MAE indicate that the results obtained do not exhibit strong distinctive characteristics and reflect a certain difficulty for the model to find a proper pattern on which to base the classification.\n",

    "The generative CycleGAN model was successfully implemented; however, some significant issues were encountered. The generative model proved to be too weak in recognizing and applying patterns to generate new images, particularly when using MRI brain scan images that depict the complex structure of the brain, which is considerably different from representations found in typical non-medical images. As a result, the generated images did not differ significantly from the original images, posing challenges for classification by the customized InceptionV3 classifier.\n",
    "There can be several solutions to improve the performance of the generative model. One of them could be the use of a larger number of images for training. By having a greater amount of data, the model would have more resources to generate more realistic images. Another possible solution is to increase the complexity of the model, such as implementing even deeper neural networks. By increasing the number of layers or the number of neurons per layer, the model would have a better ability to learn the relationships among different image features. This solution, however, would lead to a higher workload on the involved hardware and therefore require longer timeframes, especially during the training stage. Further performance improvement for the generative model could be achieved by adding a properly trained detection model that can recognize and localize the typical brain structures associated with the disease. This additional model could guide the CycleGAN model to focus its attention only on determining areas of the images that are of real interest."
